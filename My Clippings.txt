Thus, the sequence in interrogating reality is: 1. Fill out the issue prep form. 2. Invite those whose input will be important to the issue, let them know what the topic will be, why it is significant, and that you look forward to learning their perspective. 3. Once the team is assembled, quickly take them through the issue form and let them know which way you’re leaning. 4. Invite competing perspectives (this is obviously the longest part of the meeting). Probe. Be curious. 5. Ask them to write down: Given everything we’ve explored together, what would you do if you were in my shoes? (Or simply, what would you advise?) Then ask everyone to read their suggestions aloud. No discussion. Just say, “Thank you.” 6. Tell them what you heard, collect their ideas with signatures, and thank them for their input.

Regularly interrogating reality in your workplace is the cornerstone of great leadership, healthy cultures, intelligent strategies, and wholehearted execution. What has changed? Does the plan still make sense? If not, what is required of you? of others? Since everyone owns a piece of the truth about reality, consider whose realities should be explored before important decisions are made. Avoid blame by modifying your language.
